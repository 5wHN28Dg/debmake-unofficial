# Lists directories to be created in package. (w/o preceding slash)
# Do not bother to list directories here if they are already listed in
# any debian/install or debian/<binary-packagename>.install
#
# Any directories which we need but which are not created by the normal
# installation procedure (make install DESTDIR=... invoked by
# dh_auto_install). This generally means there is a problem with the
# Makefile.

# * This is for the first binary package listed in debian/control
# * Create debian/<binary-packagename>.dirs if needed for the non-first binary
#   package listed in debian/control
