# You must remove unused comment lines for the released package.
# See dh_installexamples(1)

# If upstream provides an examples directory, you will often want to use
# examples/* rather than examples in this file.  The latter would create
# /usr/share/doc/package/examples/examples directory.

# * This is for the first binary package listed in debian/control
# * Create debian/<binary-packagename>.examples if needed for the non-first
#   binary package listed in debian/control
