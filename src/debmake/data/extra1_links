# You must remove unused comment lines for the released package.
# See dh_link(1) (copy to each binary package as needed.)
#
# Each line lists as:
# <link_source_path> <link_destination_path>
#
# Here:
#   * Both <link_source_path> <link_destination_path> are absolute path
#   * The leading slash is optional

# * This is for the first binary package listed in debian/control
# * Create debian/<binary-packagename>.links if needed for the non-first binary
#   package listed in debian/control
